# GrindCutter
Minecraft 1.16 - 1.17 Datapack


A Minecraft datapack for Java version 1.16 or 1.17 Snapshot

Newly-placed stonecutters will "mine" blocks above them. This unlocks new Redstone farming possibilities like an explosion-free cobblestone machine, wood-mining machine, basalt machine, and more!

Things to keep in mind:
Stonecutters mine blocks!
They can't break bedrock or obsidian.
Only new stonecutters can mine blocks -- old ones work normally
To prevent duping, stonecutters cannot always be placed next to each otherwhen pushed by a piston, the stonecutter loses its mining ability
